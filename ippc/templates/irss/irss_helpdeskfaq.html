</h5>

<div style="display:none" id="what">
    <p>
        The Implementation Review and Support System is a programme whose primary objective is to facilitate and promote the implementation of the IPPC and ISPMs. An outcome of the Open-Ended Working Group on a possible IPPC Compliance Mechanism (September 2007), it serves as the IPPCs primary means of identifying and addressing emerging and potential implementation problems before they become disputes. For more information about IRSS, what we do and how we do it, please go to the About IRSS Section of the IRSS webpage.

</h5>

<div style="display:none" id="ispm15mark">
    <p>
        Approval to use the ISPM 15 mark can only be given by a National Plant Protection Organisation or an organisation officially audited and mandated by the NPPO.

    <a onclick="javascript:toggle_visibility('ispm15info');">Where can I find information on countries implementing ISPM 15?</a>
</h5>

<div style="display:none" id="ispm15info">
    <p>Many countries have provided specific answers to the following questions: whether&nbsp; ISPM 15 has been implemented for imports or exports and if so, which version (2002 or 2009); whether wood packaging is regulated differently than outlined in ISPM 15; whether the mark has been registered in the country; where to find national legislation and/or relevant websites; and who to contact for more information regarding ISPM 15.</p>
    <p>This information has been compiled into <a href="https://www.ippc.int/countries/all/ispm15">following table</a>.</p>
    <p>IPPC contact points are able to respond to information requests and communicate on phytosanitary issues on behalf of their country.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.ippc.int/countries/all/contactpoints/">Here is a list of official contact information for NPPOs</a>.</p>

    <a onclick="javascript:toggle_visibility('ispmbook');">Is it possible to download a document/book containing all ISPMs?</a>
</h5>

<div style="display:none" id="ispmbook">
    <p>The Secretariat will no longer be posting the adopted&nbsp; ISPMs as a single book (formerly known as the Book of Standards). Instead, we will only be posting them individually. <a href="https://www.ippc.int/standards/">Here is the complete list of adopted ISPMs</a>.</p>

    <a onclick="javascript:toggle_visibility('ispmlanguage');">I can't find an ISPM I in the language I am looking for</a>
</h5>

<div style="display:none" id="ispmlanguage">
    <p>ISPMs may not be available in all languages for a period of time after CPM. This is because they are revised by FAO translation services as is custom after adoption. In the meantime, should you wish to consult the standards, the *non revised* language versions can be found under the <a href="https://www.ippc.int/cpm/">list of CPM documents</a>.<br></p>

  <a onclick="javascript:toggle_visibility('BenefitsRegisteringIspm15');" title="Click this link and copy the URL from the web browser address bar for a direct link to this particular FAQ.">What are the benefits of registering the ISPM 15 symbol?</a>
</h5>

<div style="display:none" id="BenefitsRegisteringIspm15">
  <p>The ISPM 15 symbol enjoys a widespread use and recognition worldwide. The symbol has a significant impact on many industries and, consequently, on national economies and at the international level.  The symbol, therefore, has great economic value for all, and the potential consequences of failing to protect the ISPM 15 symbol are profound.
</p>
  
  <p>Registration provides the highest level of protection for the symbol, and helps shield countries from trade disruptions and related negative economic impacts.  In addition, registration is a fundamental part of the common effort of FAO and IPPC signatory countries to ensure effective management of the trade in wood packaging material, to prevent the introduction and spread of pests and diseases that are harmful to plant resources worldwide.  Prompt registration will help achieve global ISPM 15 coverage, and ensure phytosanitary security in the global trade system.</p>

  <p>Registration through FAO is easy, efficient and convenient for countries because FAO handles all aspects of the registration, as described below.</p>

<h5 class="faqq"  >
  <a onclick="javascript:toggle_visibility('ConsequencesNonRegistrationIspm15');" title="Click this link and copy the URL from the web browser address bar for a direct link to this particular FAQ.">What are the consequences of non-registration of the ISPM 15 symbol?</a>
</h5>

<div style="display:none" id="ConsequencesNonRegistrationIspm15">
  <p>Failure to register the symbol will undermine the integrity of the entire ISPM 15 system worldwide. The current gaps in registration pose a significant risk from a global plant health perspective, and from legal and commercial standpoints.  The fact that some countries do not ensure proper registration creates a risk of opportunistic or malevolent use of the symbol by third parties, with consequent adverse effects on international trade, national economies, and phytosanitary security.</p>

  <p>Legally, registration of the mark provides the most complete protection and gives the most effective legal tools should actions against a third party become necessary.</p>

  <a onclick="javascript:toggle_visibility('WhyFaoOwnership');" title="Click this link and copy the URL from the web browser address bar for a direct link to this particular FAQ.">Why does FAO own the ISPM 15 symbol?</a>
</h5>

<div style="display:none" id="WhyFaoOwnership">
  <p>Most national laws require that an entity be entrusted with the responsibility of ensuring that any product or service bearing a certification symbol like the ISPM 15 meets the required characteristics.  Consolidated ownership of the symbol in one entity ensures a consistent management and monitoring of the symbol worldwide.</p>
    
  <p>FAO is an impartial guardian and promoter of phytosanitary security and seeks to ensure countries' common interest in effective and fair use of the symbol.  It is also responsible for administering the IPPC, under which the symbol was developed.  By virtue of its ownership of the symbol, FAO fulfills the functions described above, and protects the symbol's warranty function, thus helping ensure fairness in international trade.</p>

  <a onclick="javascript:toggle_visibility('HowRegister');" title="Click this link and copy the URL from the web browser address bar for a direct link to this particular FAQ.">How does registration of the ISPM 15 symbol work?</a>
</h5>

<div style="display:none" id="HowRegister">
  <p>As endorsed by the Committee on Phytosanitary Measures (CPM), the registration will be handled by FAO.</p>
  
  <p>The CPM has planned that all outstanding registrations should be completed within a period of five years.  During this timeframe, FAO will process individual registrations gradually, in accordance with a set of criteria established by the IPPC Secretariat.FAO will inform countries when it initiates the registration process for them.  It will then handle all administrative and legal procedures required for registration, until completion.  FAO will notify the concerned country when the registration process is over.</p>

<h5 class="faqq" >
  <a onclick="javascript:toggle_visibility('WhyRenew');" title="Click this link and copy the URL from the web browser address bar for a direct link to this particular FAQ.">Why should countries renew registration of the ISPM 15 symbol?</a>
</h5>

<div style="display:none" id="WhyRenew">
  <p>Expiry of the symbol's registration means that the legal protection for the symbol no longer exists.</p>
  <p>Renewing the symbol's registration will ensure the benefits described above continue to apply, thus ensuring continuity, fairness and efficiency in international trade, and increased phytosanitary security worldwide.</p>
</div>

<h5 class="faqq" >
  <a onclick="javascript:toggle_visibility('HowMuch');" title="Click this link and copy the URL from the web browser address bar for a direct link to this particular FAQ.">How much do registration and renewal cost?</a>
</h5>

<div style="display:none" id="HowMuch">
  <p>The cost of registration and/or renewal varies from country to country.  Upon request, or through the reimbursement process (see below), FAO will provide information about the cost to the country.</p>
</div>

<h5 class="faqq"  >
  <a onclick="javascript:toggle_visibility('HowReimburse');" title="Click this link and copy the URL from the web browser address bar for a direct link to this particular FAQ.">How to reimburse FAO for expenses related to registration or renewal?</a>
</h5>

<div style="display:none" id="HowReimburse">
  <p>The CPM has encouraged countries to reimburse FAO for costs incurred in the process of registering or renewing registration of the ISPM 15 symbol for countries.  
At the beginning of the registration or renewal process, FAO will inform them of the corresponding cost and the reimbursement process.  They will then have the opportunity to confirm their willingness to reimburse FAO for the costs incurred.</p>
  <p>After receiving each reimbursement, FAO will issue an official receipt, if requested.</p>

<h5 class="faqq"  >
  <a onclick="javascript:toggle_visibility('whatpce');">What is the Phytosanitary Capacity Evaluation (PCE)</a>
</h5>

<div style="display:none" id="whatpce">
  <p>The PCE, or Phytosanitary Capacity Evaluation, is a management tool designed to help a country to identify both strengths and gaps in its existing and planned phytosanitary systems.</p>
</div>

<h5 class="faqq">
  <a onclick="javascript:toggle_visibility('benefitspce');">What Are the Benefits of the PCE?</a>
</h5>

<div style="display:none" id="benefitspce">
  <p>The PCE generates a snapshot of a country's phytosanitary capacity at a particular time, and provides a framework for rational strategic planning. The PCE allows for the prioritization of activities/resources to fill capacity gaps and enhance the effectiveness of the overall phytosanitary system. Strategic plans developed through the PCE also provides the basis for dialogue with donors of development aid and thus improve the likelihood of access to further funding.</p>
</div>

<h5 class="faqq" >
  <a onclick="javascript:toggle_visibility('applypce');">How is the PCE Applied?</a>
</h5>

<div style="display:none" id="applypce">
  <p>The entire PCE process is under the control of the country â€“ it is not something that is done TO a country, it is a framework that the country adopts for its own purposes and benefits.</p>

  <p>The PCE is a modular online software system consisting of 13 semi structured questionnaire type modules that can be selected and applied in total or in clusters according to the preferences of the national plant protection organization (NPPO).</p>

  <p>The process is implemented through a consensus driven and confidential process amongst concerned stakeholders (public and private) to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the phytosanitary system. The PCE contains strategic planning tools that guide users to develop a strategic framework consisting of logical frameworks for each module which together are used to develop a national phytosanitary action plan (NPAP).</p>

  <p>The results are intended to be used by NPPOs, and more broadly by government agencies, as a basis to identify capacity building or infrastructure needs and actions to address them. These are not publicly released unless a country wishes to use or present their PCE results externally. The PCE is designed to be implemented at a pace defined by the country over a number of weeks. The IPPC recommends that a complete PCE be applied every 3-4 years.</p>
</div>

<h5 class="faqq"  >
  <a onclick="javascript:toggle_visibility('whopce');">Who Should Be Involved in Conducting a PCE?</a>
</h5>

<div style="display:none" id="whopce">
  <p>The process is driven by staff of the NPPO but should involve non-NPPO representatives from appropriate government agencies, research institutes, universities, agro-industries or import/export associations, etc. The IPPC recommends involvement of a knowledgeable and experienced facilitator.</p>
</div>

<h5 class="faqq"  >
  <a onclick="javascript:toggle_visibility('whenpce');">When Should a PCE be Applied?</a>
</h5>

<div style="display:none" id="whenpce">
  <p>The PCE can be applied in total or in parts and as frequently as needed. It is a good compliment to the national planning process of the NPPO. When seeking external funds for phytosanitary development it is recommended that the project be formulated on the basis of the results of the PCE.</p>
</div>

<h5 class="faqq" >
  <a onclick="javascript:toggle_visibility('financepce');">How is a PCE Financed?</a>
</h5>

<div style="display:none" id="financepce">
  <p>Some contracting parties are capable of financing the process unilaterally, e.g. from the national budget. In other situations, donors may pay for the application of the PCE. The IPPC does not fund the application of a PCE but works in close collaboration with donors to provide the support for the application of a PCE when requested. In all cases some counterpart resources should be considered and allocated at the na tional level to undertake planning, stakeholder identification and resource allocation for workshops to support and ensure that the PCE process is successfully completed.</p>

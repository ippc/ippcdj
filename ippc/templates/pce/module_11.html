The NPPO capacity to conduct Pest Risk Analysis determines its ability to comply with the international agreements in relation to the application of phytosanitary measures for the exclusion of regulated pests. The International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC, 1997, Article VII.2a) requires that: 'Contracting parties shall not ... take any of the measures specified in paragraph 1 of this Article [i.e. phytosanitary measures] unless such measures are made necessary by phytosanitary considerations and are technically justified.' Article VI.1b requires that phytosanitary measures are: 'limited to what is necessary to protect plant health and/or safeguard the intended use and can be technically justified by the contracting party concerned.' 'Technically justified' is defined in Article II.1 as: 'justified on the basis of conclusions reached by using an appropriate pest risk analysis or, where applicable, another comparable examination and evaluation of available scientific information.' Article IV.2f states that the responsibilities of the National Plant Protection Organization (NPPO) include 'the conduct of pest risk analyses'. The issuing of regulations is a responsibility of the contracting party to the IPPC (Article IV.3c), although contracting parties may delegate this responsibility to the NPPO. <a href='https://www.ippc.int/en/publications/592/'>ISPM 2</a> FRAMEWORK FOR PEST RISK ANALYSIS (2007) provides a framework that describes the pest risk analysis (PRA) process within the scope of the IPPC. It introduces the three stages of pest risk analysis - initiation, pest risk assessment and pest risk management. The Standard focuses on the initiation stage. Generic issues of information gathering, documentation, risk communication, uncertainty and consistency are addressed. The pest risk analysis (PRA) process is a technical tool used for identifying appropriate phytosanitary measures. The PRA process may be used for organisms not previously recognized as pests (such as plants, biological control agents, other beneficial organisms, or living modified organisms), recognized pests, pathways and review of phytosanitary policy. The process consists of three stages: 1: Initiation; 2: Pest risk assessment; and 3: Pest risk management. The Standard provides detailed guidance on PRA Stage 1, summarizes PRA Stages 2 and 3, and addresses generic issues in the overall PRA process. For Stages 2 and 3 it refers to ISPMs <a href='https://www.ippc.int/en/publications/600/'>No. 3</a>, <a href='https://www.ippc.int/en/publications/639/'>No. 11</a> and <a href='https://www.ippc.int/en/publications/601/'>No. 21</a> dealing with the PRA process. The PRA process is initiated in Stage 1 with the identification of an organism or pathway that may be considered for pest risk assessment, or as part of the review of existing phytosanitary measures, in relation to a defined PRA area. The first step is to determine or confirm whether or not the organism considered is a pest. If no pests are identified, the analysis need not continue. The analysis of pests identified in Stage 1 continues to Stages 2 and 3 using guidance provided in other standards. Information gathering, documentation and risk communication, as well as uncertainty and consistency, are issues common to all PRA stages. <a href='https://www.ippc.int/en/publications/600/'>ISPM 3</a> GUIDELINES FOR THE EXPORT, SHIPMENT, IMPORT AND RELEASE OF BIOLOGICAL CONTROL AGENTS AND OTHER BENEFICIAL ORGANISMS (2005) provides guidelines for risk management related to the export, shipment, import and release of biological control agents and other beneficial organisms. It lists the related responsibilities of contracting parties to the IPPC ('contracting parties'), National Plant Protection Organizations (NPPOs) or other responsible authorities, importers and exporters (as described in the standard). The standard addresses biological control agents capable of self-replication (including parasitoids, predators, parasites, nematodes, phytophagous organisms, and pathogens such as fungi, bacteria and viruses), as well as sterile insects and other beneficial organisms (such as mycorrhizae and pollinators), and includes those packaged or formulated as commercial products. Provisions are also included for import for research in quarantine facilities of non-indigenous biological control agents and other beneficial organisms. Most of this standard is based on the premise that a biological control agent or other beneficial organism may be a potential pest itself, and in this sense Article VII.1c of the IPPC (1997) applies because contracting parties may prohibit or restrict the movement of regulated pests into their territories. In some situations, biological control agents and other beneficial organisms may act as a carrier or pathway for plant pests, hyperparasitoids, hyperparasites and entomopathogens. In this sense, biological control agents and other beneficial organisms may be considered to be regulated articles as described in Article VII.1 of the IPPC (1997) and <a href='https://www.ippc.int/en/publications/602/'>ISPM No. 20</a>: Guidelines for a phytosanitary import regulatory system. <br><a href='https://www.ippc.int/en/publications/639/'>ISPM 11</a> Pest Risk Analysis for Quarantine Pests Including Analysis of Environmental Risks and Living Modified Organisms (2013) provides details for the conduct of pest risk analysis (PRA) to determine if pests are quarantine pests. It describes the integrated processes to be used for risk assessment as well as the selection of risk management options. The objectives of a PRA are, for a specified area, to identify pests and/or pathways of quarantine concern and evaluate their risk, to identify endangered areas, and, if appropriate, to identify risk management options. Pest risk analysis (PRA) for quarantine pests follows a process defined by three stages: Stage 1 (initiating the process) involves identifying the pest(s) and pathways that are of quarantine concern and should be considered for risk analysis in relation to the identified PRA area. Stage 2 (risk assessment) begins with the categorization of individual pests to determine whether the criteria for a quarantine pest are satisfied. Risk assessment continues with an evaluation of the probability of pest entry, establishment, and spread, and of their potential economic consequences. Stage 3 (risk management) involves identifying management options for reducing the risks identified at stage 2. These are evaluated for efficacy, feasibility and impact in order to select those that are appropriate. <a href='https://www.ippc.int/en/publications/601/'>ISPM 21</a> PEST RISK ANALYSIS FOR REGULATED NON-QUARANTINE PESTS (2004) provides guidelines for conducting pest risk analysis (PRA) for regulated non-quarantine pests (RNQPs). It describes the integrated processes to be used for risk assessment and the selection of risk management options to achieve a pest tolerance level. The classification of a pest as an RNQP and any restrictions placed on the import of the plant species with which it is associated should be justified by PRA. It is necessary to demonstrate that plants for planting are a pathway for the pest and that the plants for planting are the main source of infestation (transmission pathway) of the pest that results in an economically unacceptable impact on the intended use of those plants. It is not necessary to evaluate the probability of establishment or the long-term economic impact of an RNQP. Market access (i.e. access to export markets) and environmental effects are not considered relevant for RNQPs, since RNQPs are already present.. Pest risk assessment needs to be only as complex as is technically justified by the circumstances. This standard allows a specific PRA to be judged against the principles of necessity, minimal impact, transparency, equivalence, risk analysis, managed risk and non-discrimination set out in <a href='https://www.ippc.int/en/publications/596/'>ISPM 1</a> : Principles of plant quarantine as related to international trade as well as the interpretation and application of official control (see <a href='https://www.ippc.int/en/publications/622/'>ISPM No. 5</a> Glossary of phytosanitary terms, Supplement No. 1: Guidelines on the interpretation and application of the concept of official control for regulated pests). <a href='https://www.ippc.int/en/publications/607/'>ISPM 14</a> - The Use of Integrated Measures in a Systems Approach for Pest Risk Management (2002): provides guidelines for the development and evaluation of integrated measures in a systems approach as an option for pest risk management under the relevant international standards for pest risk analysis designed to meet phytosanitary requirements for the import of plants, plant products and other regulated articles. <a href='https://www.ippc.int/en/publications/597/'>ISPM 24</a> - Guidelines for the Determination and Recognition of Equivalence of Phytosanitary Measures (2005): discusses the applicable principles and requirements for the determination of equivalence of phytosanitary measures.<br>Guidance questions for the assessment of PRA capacity<br>Keep the following questions in mind while working through this module:<br>1.

</h1> 
    <p>The IPPC identifies phytosanitary information which is exchanged, by contracting parties, the Secretariat and at times the Regional Plant Protection Organizations (RPPOs). There are three categories of information that can be posted via the IPP in order to meet IPPC information exchange obligations: basic reporting (description of the NPPO, list of Entry points, lists of regulated pests, phytosanitary restrictions), event-driven reporting (non-compliance, emergency actions, pest report), and request-driven reporting (organizational arrangements, rationale for phytosanitary requirements, pest status). <br><br>
    <b>The tables below show the number of IPP pages per country pertaining to each reporting type. </b>    <br><br>
    <em>Mouseover the reporting types for more information.<br> 
        Click on the country name to go to that country's IPP pages.</em>    <br><br>
